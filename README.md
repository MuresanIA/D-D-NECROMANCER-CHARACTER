### As a mere mortal, Midnight was focused on helping others. He was one of a kind in the field of medicine, and some called him a black magic practitioner. In 1346, the black death pain was felt throughout Europe, and the population was decimated.
### He had a vast collection of medicine devices and cures with him when he sailed away from Transilvania, unconcerned about what could happen to him. He was equipped with knowledge and the desire to save others.
