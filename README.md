# Background story:

### As a mere mortal, Damian Tepes was focused on helping others. He was one of a kind in the field of medicine, and some called him a black magic practitioner. In 1346, the black death pain was felt throughout Europe, and the population was decimated.
### He had a vast collection of medicine devices and cures with him when he traveled away from Transilvania in 1347 to reach England, unconcerned about what could happen to him. He was equipped with knowledge and the desire to save others.
### During his journey across Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia, Germany, and the Netherlands on his dark and massive horse, he encountered many foes, many cultures, and many practices that pointed him out as a false prophet who cures the living dead.
### In his mind, he always heard a voice calling to him, a dark, rusty, powerful and evil voice. Always whispering in his mind, "Sooner or later, all of them will be in my army, no matter how many you cure or delay, they will become part of me.".
### Though he always thinks he is a sick man with strong ambitions and vast intellect, his life is bound to burnout more quickly than the others, but at least he did not lead an empty and pathetic life. Even if the voice inside his mind is getting louder.
### Arriving in The Netherlands, Rotterdam, in 25th May 1348, it was a warm and welcoming day, but the odor of death, decay, panic, and hysteria was spreading like magma from an active volcano. He stared into nothingness, emptiness, while the symphony of death was playing in the life's background, louder, louder and louder, making the deff men dance one last time.
### He was in need of a ship. The logistics ship was gathering resources for England. The crew was in need of a doctor who could solve the mystery of hysteria and death. Armed with medical devices and cures, he was taken on board, praised like a God bringing light into the darkness.
### That didn't last very long. They have seen his medical devices. They were a product of pure mathematics, geometry, and years of anatomy and dissection. He took blood samples from the crew members, he never saw the skin shattering on a living corpse because of a virus. He tried to explain to them that they are all going to die if he does not come up with a cure for it. Although he cured tens of men sick of pneumonia on the sea, they considered him a monster because of his practices.
### As he arrived in the United Kingdom, on the first day of his final voyage on the sea, he healed the humans who had fallen ill. It was on the 5th of June 1348 that both Damian and the Black Plague first set foot in England. In one, life is ripped from bodies, while in the other, hope is given.
### In the morning of the 10th of June, Damian arrived in England, he already knew that there will be no chance for the virus to spread since he had developed a cure against it during the days at sea. On the streets of England, he began healing the dying. No wonder they died of black plague and infections, they lived in a miserable town, washed only once in dreams, and the smell was horrid.
### The man was doing what he does best, healing and sacrificing his life for the greater good. The artist of life and death proves his strength against the forces of death. He knew from a young age that life is like a river, and it requires a steady flow to be successful and pure.
### As Damian disturbed the balance between life and death, he awakened something almost forgotten even in mythology. Over the eons of time, something stronger and darker than the abyss itself has awakened. The entity's world was shaken by Damanian's actions. Healing the dying, he was slowly taking the pillow beneath the entity's head.
### After glorious attempts at healing, all of them succeeding, Damian was victorious against the Black Plague, but the price was far more than the reward itself. During the next day, Damian fell ill. He was not responding to the treatment, none of his medicines worked.
### Before death, he heard a whisper in his ears "You who awakened me, will know no death nor taste, smell, passion or love for life". Damian slowly responded, "Death is most welcome in times like these", thinking he might hallucinate. A minute later, his soul is slowly losing control of his body.
### Minutes after his death, Damian awakens in a world so cold, so dark, so empty, and fueled by the souls of death that he feels petrified. Taking a long look, he sees an entity devouring the souls that enter the portal. It was standing between two mountains, so huge that the sky was bleeding on their tops.
### Damian's soul is pulled right in front of the entity, staring at each other for a short time. The entity speaks "We are enemies you and I, you delayed thousands of souls with your medicine, healed more than you can grab, you were a man of science and logic, but what do you say about what you see now?". Damian with no doubt and states that this is a hallucination.
### The voice deepens inside Damian's mind, "Now that you have awakened me, I need a vessel to get out and resume my work that was almost complete. I am Nagash the father of necromancy, the God of Death. The whole world will bend to my will. Your body is not dead yet, you are in a coma, just enough to allow me to leave. The midnight of life will fall upon this reality and everything that life holds most dear will collapse to ruin and disease under my foot."

# Necromancer Spell List tutorial list

## Spellcasting
### You draw on the negative energy in the world to fuel your spells.

## Cantrips
### At 1st level, you know 2 cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Necromancer table.

## Spell Slots
### The Necromancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### For example, if you know the 1st-level spell false life and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast false life using either slot.

## Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
### You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the wizard spell list.

### The Spells Known column of the Necromancer table shows when you learn more necromancer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

### Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the necromancer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the wizard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

## Spellcasting Ability
### Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your necromancer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a necromancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

### Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

## Ritual Casting
### You can cast a necromancer spell as a ritual if it is a spell you know and that spell has the ritual tag.

## Spellcasting Focus
### You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your necromancer spells.

## Life Tap
### Starting at 1st level, your touch can siphon the life force of others to bolster your own. As an action, you can make a melee spell attack against a living creature, dealing necrotic damage equal to 1d8 + your Charisma modifier on a hit. You gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt. If this feature kills the creature, you gain twice as many temporary hit points from using this feature. The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier(minimum one) and you regain all uses of this feature at the end of a long rest.

## Necromancer Occult
### At 2nd level, you choose an occult which specializes you in your dealings with death: Keeper, Reaper, Undertaker, and Witch Doctor each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your occult grants you features when you choose it at 2nd level and additional features at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

## Soul Harvest
### Starting at 3rd level, by reaping life you are able to claim a fraction of those unfortunate creatures souls to regenerate your wounds and fortify your body. At the end of your turn, if you or any undead under your control have killed one or more creatures whose CR is greater than 1, you regain hit points equal to your necromancer level. If doing so would grant you more hit points than you can have, you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of excess hit points received.

## Ability Score Increase
### When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Spontaneous Unburial
### Starting at 5th level, your understanding of necrotic and negative energies allows you to raise the dead with ease. You may cast the spell animate dead as an action and you do not require a corpse or pile of bones to do so; the skeleton or zombie will claw its way up from underground and acts on your next turn. In addition, you learn the spell animate dead. This spell does not count against your number of spells known but still requires a spell slot to cast.

## Animate Major Undead
### Beginning at 7th level, your pursuit of knowledge has led to uncover the secrets to mastering undead of all sizes. You can now raise any corpse that is Huge or smaller of a monstrosity, humanoid, or beast with challenge rating 3 or lower can be animated. It keeps its original abilities and attacks, but loses any resistances, immunities, legendary actions, senses it had and gains the immunities and vulnerabilities of its type, skeleton or zombie. You can issue mental commands to the creature as the animate dead spell. You can only control one major undead at a time. This feature functions as the spell animate dead except where otherwise noted. You may use this feature on an existing undead you control to reassert your control over it. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

### At level 11, you may animate a monstrosity, humanoid or beast with a challenge rating of 6 or lower.

### At level 15, you may animate a monstrosity, humanoid or beast with a challenge rating of 9 or lower. In addition, a major undead now lasts until its hit points are reduced to 0.

## Ritualistic Unburial
### At level 14th level, the repetitive nature of raising your undead has become like a ritual for you. You may cast animate dead as a ritual.

## Macabre
### Starting at 18th level, the death you surround yourself with has become part of you. Your flesh has become pale and your eyes have taken on a yellow tint. Some necromancers alter their appearance with stitches sewn on their face, body, legs, or arms. Others may adorn the remains of corpses to impose fear and keep people away. The overexposure to death has earned an affinity with undead. Whenever you interact with undead, you have advantage on all Charisma checks. In addition, while you may look sick and exhausted from the constant dealings with death, you do not age and you are immune to poison damage, diseases, exhuastion, as well as the frightened and poisoned conditions.

## Séance
### Starting at 20th level, your presence commands respect from undead. As a bonus action, the necromancer can target an undead creature they can see within 30 feet of them. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey the necromancer's commands for the next 24 hours, or until the necromancer uses Séance again.
