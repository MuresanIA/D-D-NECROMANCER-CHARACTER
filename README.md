# Background story:

### As a mere mortal, Damian Tepes was focused on helping others. He was one of a kind in the field of medicine, and some called him a black magic practitioner. In 1346, the black death pain was felt throughout Europe, and the population was decimated.
### He had a vast collection of medicine devices and cures with him when he traveled away from Transilvania in 1347 to reach England, unconcerned about what could happen to him. He was equipped with knowledge and the desire to save others.
### During his journey across Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia, Germany, and the Netherlands on his dark and massive horse, he encountered many foes, many cultures, and many practices that pointed him out as a false prophet who cures the living dead.
### In his mind, he always heard a voice calling to him, a dark, rusty, powerful and evil voice. Always whispering in his mind, "Sooner or later, all of them will be in my army, no matter how many you cure or delay, they will become part of me.".
### Though he always thinks he is a sick man with strong ambitions and vast intellect, his life is bound to burnout more quickly than the others, but at least he did not lead an empty and pathetic life. Even if the voice inside his mind is getting louder.
### Arriving in The Netherlands, Rotterdam, in 25th May 1348, it was a warm and welcoming day, but the odor of death, decay, panic, and hysteria was spreading like magma from an active volcano. He stared into nothingness, emptiness, while the symphony of death was playing in the life's background, louder, louder and louder, making the deff men dance one last time.
### He was in need of a ship. The logistics ship was gathering resources for England. The crew was in need of a doctor who could solve the mystery of hysteria and death. Armed with medical devices and cures, he was taken on board, praised like a God bringing light into the darkness.
