# Background story:

### As a mere mortal, Midnight was focused on helping others. He was one of a kind in the field of medicine, and some called him a black magic practitioner. In 1346, the black death pain was felt throughout Europe, and the population was decimated.
### He had a vast collection of medicine devices and cures with him when he traveled away from Transilvania, unconcerned about what could happen to him. He was equipped with knowledge and the desire to save others.
### During his journey across Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia, Germany, and the Netherlands on his dark and glorious horse, he encountered many foes, many cultures, and many practices that pointed him out as a false prophet who cures the living dead.
### In his mind, he always heard a voice calling to him, a dark, rusty, powerful and evil voice. Always whispering in his ears, "Sooner or later, you'll all be in my army, no matter how many you cure or delay, you'll all become part of me.".
